Part II

1. What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out?
    man lists the manual of options for anything you want to do in the terminal/shell. From what I've seen to scroll/leave the man rm command, you can move around pages using the space bar, the arrow keys, or ctrl d/b/u to scroll half/whole pages.

2. Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the -a flag do?
    -l creates a list format. -a lists every file.

3. How do you jump between words in the terminal?
    alt left and alt right (or option left/right)

4. How do you get to the end of a line in terminal?
    ctrl e

5. How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal?
    ctrl a

6. How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal?
    ctrl w

7. What is the difference between a terminal and shell?
    The terminal is the program that let's you use the shell. It used to be a physical item before it was softwared in. The shell is the program that uses our inputs and acts accordingly. The shell handles the interactions, while the terminal is the space that allows the interactions.

8. What is an absolute path?
    An absolute path starts at the root and gives the entire path from root to current pwd

9. What is an relative path?
    A relative path starts at the current place

10. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
    A flag lets us alter what a command can do. -r, -a, -l.

11. What do the r and f flags do with the rm command?
    -r removes folders, and then goes through each file. f simply forces the removal of the folder.
